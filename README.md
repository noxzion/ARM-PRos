**A minimalistic 64-bit operating system written in C and Assembly for ARMv8-A architecture**

</div>

## Overview

**ARM-PRos** is my experimental operating system project for the ARMv8-A architecture. It's practically bare bones right now, but if I find the strength to develop this project further, I'll try to turn it into something more. 

## Roadmap

- [x] UART Driver: Basic text output (puts, puthex, putc)
- [ ] UART Input
- [ ] Interrupt Controller (GIC)
- [ ] Keyboard Driver
- [ ] Timer Driver
- [ ] String Library (`strcmp`, `strlen`, `atoi`)
- [ ] Kernel Shell
- [ ] Physical Memory Manager
- [ ] PCI Scanning

## Building from Source

Install `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` compiler using your package manager, then run build script:

```bash
chmod +x build-linux.sh
./build-linux.sh
```

## Runing ARM-PRos

Install `qemu-system-aarch64` emulator then run this command:

```bash
./run-linux.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -M virt \
    -cpu cortex-a53 \
    -m 1024 \
    -kernel build/KERNEL.ELF \
    -serial stdio \
    -display none
```

### Raspberry Pi 3B Note

Raspberry Pi 3B emulation is not yet fully supported on QEMU. Currently, the OS is configured to run on the QEMU `virt` machine which provides full functionality. Porting to Raspberry Pi will require additional device driver implementations and memory layout adjustments.
